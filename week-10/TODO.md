# Financial Market Crash Anomaly Detection & Investment Strategy

## Milestone 1: Anomaly Detection Model

### Data Acquisition

- Obtain historical financial market data (e.g., stock prices, indices, VIX, bond yields, etc.)
- Options include:
  - Using the provided dataset
  - Sourcing data from public repositories (like Macrotrends, FRED, etc.)
  - Combining multiple sources

### Data Preprocessing

- Clean and prepare the data for analysis
- Tasks include:
  - Handling missing values
  - Converting data types
  - Normalizing/standardizing values
  - Feature engineering (e.g., calculating moving averages, volatility indicators)

### Anomaly Detection Model Selection

- Research and select appropriate machine learning model for binary classification (crash vs. no crash)
- Consider:
  - Logistic regression
  - Neural networks
  - Clustering algorithms
  - Other suitable techniques for anomaly detection

### Model Training

- Split data into training and testing sets
  - Consider time series nature to avoid data leakage
- Train selected model on training set
- Evaluate performance on testing set

### Model Optimization

- Tune model hyperparameters
- Optimize performance for relevant metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Other metrics as needed

## Milestone 2: Investment Strategy

### Strategy Definition

- Based on anomaly detection model predictions
- Define data-driven investment strategy to:
  - Minimize losses
  - Maximize returns during market crashes
- Consider:
  - Portfolio allocation adjustments
  - Hedging strategies
  - Risk management techniques

### Backtesting

- Simulate strategy performance on historical data
- Assess effectiveness

## Additional Notes

- Use visualizations (charts, graphs) for:
  - Data exploration
  - Model interpretation
  - Strategy explanation
- Regular updates:
  - Model maintenance
  - Bot data refresh
- Consider:
  - Ethical implications
  - Potential biases
