# TODO

## Project Requirements

- [x] Host an image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) on serverless GPUs through Modal, ensuring low-latency performance for smooth user experience.
- [x] Create a web app that allows users to generate images from text prompts, manage their creations, and interact socially through likes, comments, and sharing features.
- [/] Incorporate intuitive UI/UX design, authentication, and efficient image management with prompt histories.

## Challenges

- [x] Ensuring the hosted image generation model operates within low-latency thresholds (<2 seconds) while handling multiple concurrent requests
- [x] Managing the dynamic scaling of GPU resources to handle demand spikes without exceeding cost or causing performance bottlenecks.
- [/] Add the ability to search for images semantically
- [x] Prevent harmful or inappropriate content from being generated
- [x] Build a recommendation system that creates personalized feeds for users, balancing new content discovery with user preferences
