# TODO

## Project Requirements

- [ ] Host an image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) on serverless GPUs through Modal, ensuring low-latency performance for smooth user experience.
- [ ] Create a web app that allows users to generate images from text prompts, manage their creations, and interact socially through likes, comments, and sharing features.
- [ ] Incorporate intuitive UI/UX design, authentication, and efficient image management with prompt histories.

## Challenges

- [ ] Ensuring the hosted image generation model operates within low-latency thresholds (<2 seconds) while handling multiple concurrent requests
- [ ] Managing the dynamic scaling of GPU resources to handle demand spikes without exceeding cost or causing performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Add the ability to search for images semantically
- [ ] Prevent harmful or inappropriate content from being generated
- [ ] Build a recommendation system that creates personalized feeds for users, balancing new content discovery with user preferences
